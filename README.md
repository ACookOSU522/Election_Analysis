# Election_ Analysis
## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.
	
	1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
	2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
	3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
	4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
	5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: Election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6 (64-bit), Visual Studio Code 1.68.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 total votes cast in the election.

- Three Counties participated in the election:

## Challenge Overview
Utilizing new language platforms that taught blanket processes in an analysis exercise, providing a foundation knowledge base to elaborate on and fine tune as new programs/platforms are introduced.

## Challenge Summary
Working with Python and VS Code provided new methods of analyzing data. 
Advantages to these new platforms are discovering new formulas; and the error assistance window in terminal was vastly helpful!  
The biggest challenges faced were in matching indentations and fine-tuning error resolution skills; locating an error doesnt fix-it, minute tweaks (ie: space, comma,and capitalization) are important. 
Learning VSCode and Python to do the analysis work of an .xls or .csv file used fewer steps and (with practice) less user effort to obtain results.
